            <p>We are making a website project on Queer Asian Myths & Legends. We want to explore cultural folktales, myths, legends, rituals and practices that are LGBTQ—stories particular to our own personal cultures that we heard growing up, stories passed down from our ancestors, or just tales that we have researched out of curiosity. The stories we want to present range from descriptions of mythical creatures, to recounts of historic tales, to cultural practices, to just pure superstition. Through this project, we hope to invalidate existing heteronormative constructions in mythology. We also hope to use it as a platform to expose fascinating fictitious worlds that are hidden in much of Asia.
            </p>

            <p>The status of mythology varies between different cultures. Myths are generally believed to be true within the society they originate from and are deemed erroneous or fictitious elsewhere. Cultures may regard myths as containing psychological or archetypal truths. They may explain and validate social institutions of a particular culture (Pequigney, 2002), as well as perpetuate ideals, values and norms to educate members of that culture.</p>


            <p>Since the beginning of recorded history and in a multitude of cultures, myths/folklore/sacred texts have incorporated themes of same-sex eroticism and gender identity. Myths often include homosexuality, bisexuality, or transgender themes as a symbol for sacred or mythic experiences (Conner, Sparks, and Sparks, 1998). Many mythologies ascribe queer actions in humans to the action of gods or other supernatural interventions. Homoeroticism or gender variance in Asian mythology include deities that disguise themselves as another gender (i.e. the Chinese myth of Lan Caihe and Japanese myth of the kitsune), as well as androgynous or intersex beings (i.e. the Hindu myth of Ardhanarishvara and Filipino myth of Lakapati). Indian mythologist Devdutt Pattanaik writes that myths “capture the collective unconsciousness of a people,” and act as a reflection of deep-rooted beliefs about variant sexualities that may be at odds with repressive social mores (Pattanaik, 2002).</p>


            <p>LGBTQ themes in folklore tells a lot about our society; its structure, morals, values, and informs the way we navigate the world. By exploring some of the associated stories and myths, we are able to recognize that LGBTQ individuals have always existed, regardless of the number of attempts of systemic suppression or erasure.</p>

            <p>We created a google form and asked our queer Asian friends and peers to submit stories they already knew or were interested in. The following stories are those which we have collected from our ongoing google forum. We hope to have a submissions page on our final website so the community can remain engaged and the storytelling can continue to grow.</p>

            <br>
            
            <p class="big">Submissions</p>
            <p><b>Emperor Ai of Han + Dong Xian and Passions of the Cut Sleeve (Chinese: 斷袖之癖)</b>
            <br><i>Submitted by Le Lin</i>
            <br>Emperor Ai was famous for being the most effusive homosexual emperor of the Han Dynasty. Historians characterized the relationship between Emperor Ai and Dong Xian as one between lovers and referred to their relationship as “the passion of the cut sleeve” (斷袖之癖) after a story that one afternoon after falling asleep for a nap on the same bed, Emperor Ai cut off his sleeve rather than disturb the sleeping Dong Xian when he had to get out of bed. Today, ‘cut sleeve’ (断袖) is a term used to refer to romantic relationships between men.</p>
            
            <p><b>Women’s Kingdom (Chinese: 摩梭)</b>
            <br><i>Submitted by Le Lin</i>
            <br>Women’s Kingdom is a country situated in Southern Tibet. The island is believed to be inaccessible to normal travel due to its density, causing ships to sink. Occasional travellers have found themselves transported to the island by whirlwinds and reported that it is inhabited solely by women. These women have a fully functional community without men, and the only relationships are therefore between women. These women reproduce themselves by sleeping outdoors, where they become pregnant through the action of the southern wind blowing across their bodies, or by bathing in pools of water. Any male babies that are born die before the age of three.</p>
            
            <p><b>Lan Caihe (Chinese: 藍采和)</b>
            <br><i>Submitted by Le Lin</i>
            <br>Lan Caihe (藍采和) is the patron saint of florists and minstrels (or “singing courtesans” since the musical lifestyle in classical China often bore some relation to the pleasure trade). Their name means ‘red-footed genius’, alluding to a strong connection with the earth and rich soil. Their sacred emblem is the flower basket, a bamboo or wicker container born on a hoe-like handle filled up with sacred flowers, herbs, and plants. Lan Caihe is also sometimes shown holding castanets, playing a flute, or riding a crane. Ambiguity and the reversal of expectations are trademarks of this immortal as is the power of unheeded prophecy. In addition to not having a fixed gender, Lan Caihe dons heavy winter clothes in summer but strips down to a flimsy barely-there shift to sleep in snowbanks in the winter. Sometimes they are portrayed within a melting snowbank transforming into steam from quasi-divine magic.<br>
            While some of the eight immortals have lengthy or complicated creation stories (involving magic items or a lifetime of study) Lan Caihe’s apotheosis to immortality was quick and random. While playing music, drinking heavily, and otherwise entertaining at a bar, Lan Caihe got up to go to the bathroom. Suddenly, unexpectedly, they flew up to heaven on a crane letting a single shoe fall down.  Despite having immense power and magic (and immortality), Lan Caihe is frequently portrayed dressed in a frayed blue dress and only one shoe, consorting with the lowest classes of society. There are few figures from any mythology more evocative of than socially constructed nature of identity than this gender-ambiguous immortal.</p>
            
            <p><b>The Fragrant Companion (Chinese: 憐香伴)</b>
            <br><i>Submitted by Le Lin</i>
            <br>The Fragrant Companion is a Chinese play by Li Yu, written in 1651. The story is about two girls, Cui Jianyun (崔笺云) and Cao Yuhua (曹语花), who adored each other after their intercourse by writing poems and wanted to be together all the time. This story is about female homosexuality in a patrilineal society.<br>Cui Jianyun, the scholar Fan Jiefu (范介夫)'s wife, went to a temple to burn joss to the gods after her honeymoon. At the temple she meets Cao Yuhua, the daughter of Lord Cao and 2 years her junior. Madame Cui is attracted to Cao's extraordinary fragrance, and Miss Cao is attracted to Madame Cai's poetic talent. They fall in love and vow to be husband and wife in the next life. In order to live together, Madame Cui persuades her husband to send a matchmaker to Lord Cao's house, asking him to grant her daughter to him as a second wife. Lord Cao flies into a rage at the thought of his daughter becoming a mere concubine. He throws out the matchmaker, and leaves at once for the capital with Miss Cao, ordering Fan stripped of his title. After numerous twists and turns, Cui Jianyun and Cao Yuhua manage to reunite at the expense of both being the wives of Fan Jiefu.</p>
            
            <p><b>Blame over the Leftover Peach (Chinese: 余桃之罪)</b>
            <br><i>Submitted by Ethan He</i>
            <br>During the spring and autumn period, lord Wei Linggong (卫灵公) had a male lover Mi Zixia (弥子瑕), who he split peaches with (this was a huge deal because Wei Linggong had high status). As Zixia grew old, his beauty went with age and Wei Linggong started visiting Zixia less and less. Zixia continued to leave half of a peach for Wei Linggong, longing for his attention. However when Wei Linjun found the peaches he turned it against Zixia blaming him for leaving leftover peaches, which prompted Zixia’s exile.</p>
            
            <p><b>The Rabbit God Tu'er Shen (Chinese: 兔兒神)</b>
            <br><i>Submitted by Sophy Chu</i>
            <br>Tu’er Shen (兔兒神) is a Chinese deity who manages the love and sex between homosexual people. His name literally means "rabbit deity". In a folk tale from 17th century Fujian, a soldier is in love with a provincial official, and spies on him to see him naked. The official has the soldier tortured and killed, but he returns from the dead in the form of a leveret (a rabbit in its first year) in the dream of a village elder. The leveret demands that local men build a temple to him where they can burn incense in the interest of "affairs of men". The story ends: According to the customs of Fujian province, it is acceptable for a man and boy to form a bond and to speak to each other as if to brothers. Hearing the villager relate the dream, the other villagers strove to contribute money to erect the temple. They kept silent about this secret vow, which they quickly and eagerly fulfilled. Others begged to know their reason for building the temple, but they did not find out. They all went there to pray.</p>
            
                        
            <p><b>Amaterasu (Japanese: 天照)</b>
            <br><i>Submitted by Yuko Fedrau</i>
            <br>According to Japanese folklore and mythology, homosexuality was introduced into the world by Shinu No Hafuri and his lover Ama No Hafuri. These were servants of a primordial goddess, possibly the sun goddess Amaterasu. Upon the death of Shinu, Ama committed suicide from grief, and the couple were buried together in the same grave. In some tellings of the story, the sun did not shine on the burial place until the lovers were disinterred and buried separately, although whether the offence to the sun was due to the homosexual relationship is not stated.<br>
            In another tale, Amaterasu retreats from conflict with her brother Susanoo into a cave, depriving the Earth of sunlight and life. In order to coax Amaterasu from the cave, the deity of humour and dance, Ame No Uzume, performs a bawdy sexual dance that involved exposing her breast and vulva, and inviting Amaterasu to admire them. On Amaterasu's stepping out of the cave, the transgender kami Ishi Kori Dome held up a magical mirror, and the combination of the dance and her reflection fascinate Amaterasu so much that she does not notice other spirits closing the cave entrance behind her.</p>
            
            <p><b>The Story of Two Star-crossed Lovers, Orihime and Hikoboshi / Tanabata (Japanese: 七夕)</b>
            <br><i>Submitted by Yuko Fedrau (edited through the queer gaze!)</i>
            <br>Tanabata, or the Star Festival takes place on the seventh day of the seventh month to commemorate the love story of the two stars, Vega and Altair.
            <br>
            Princess Orihime, daughter of the god of heavens, was a seamstress who spent her days weaving beautiful silk clothes by the starry river, the Milky Way. Being so preoccupied with her weaving, Orihime became lonely, wishing for companionship. One day, from across the river, she saw a figure leading a herd of cows across the night sky. Intrigued, she left her weaving behind, crossing the river to meet them. She learned that the cow herder’s name was Hikoboshi, and the two fell in love instantly.
            <br>
            In their devotion, the two began to neglect their respective duties—cows wandered across the heavens freely, and the silk weavings were left forgotten. Orihime’s father then forbade the lovers to be together, permanently separating them on opposite sides of the Milky Way. However, Orihime pleaded with him, he decreed that his daughter could cross the river once a year—on the 7th day of the 7th month—to be reunited with her star-crossed lover.</p>
            
            
            <p><b>The Flower Boys of Silla Dynasty Hwarang (Korean: 화랑)</b>
            <br><i>Submitted by Tintin Yang</i>
            <br>Hwarang (화랑), also known as Flowering Knights, were an elite warrior group of male youth in Silla, an ancient kingdom of the Korean Peninsula that lasted until the 10th century (which has been deemed the most LGBTQ inclusive dynasty in Korean history so far). There were educational institutions as well as social clubs where members gathered for all aspects of study, originally for arts and culture as well as religious teachings stemming mainly from Korean Buddhism. Originally, the Hwarang were known for their use of make-up and cosmetic decorations and accessories. The Hwarang were also referred to as Hyangdo ("fragrant ones"), the word hwarang and its colloquial derivatives being used for everything from playboy to shaman or husband of a female shaman. The word remained in common use until the 12th century but with more derogatory connotations.</p>
            
             <p><b>The Ardhanarishvara (Sanskrit: अर्धनारीश्वर, Ardhanārīśwara)</b>
            <br><i>Submitted by Tiyasha Ghattak</i>
            <br>The Ardhanarishvara is a composite androgynous form of the Hindu deities Shiva and Parvati (the latter being known as Devi, Shakti and Uma in this icon). Ardhanarishvara is depicted as half-male and half-female, equally split down the middle. The right half is usually the male Shiva, illustrating his traditional attributes.
            <br>
            The earliest Ardhanarishvara images are dated to the Kushan period, starting from the first century CE. Its iconography evolved and was perfected in the Gupta era. The Puranas and various iconographic treatises write about the mythology and iconography of Ardhanarishvara. Ardhanarishvara remains a popular iconographic form found in most Shiva temples throughout India, though very few temples are dedicated to this deity.
            <br>
            Ardhanarishvara represents the synthesis of masculine and feminine energies of the universe (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of God, is inseparable from (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God. The union of these principles is exalted as the root and womb of all creation. Another view is that Ardhanarishvara is a symbol of Shiva's all-pervasive nature.</p>
            
            
            <p><b>Lakapati/Ikapati, Transgender Tagalog Goddess of Fertility & Agriculture</b>
            <br><i>Submitted by Hyacinth Wourms</i>
            <br>Known as a transgender deity and one of the most understanding and kindest deities of the Tagalogs, Lakapati is the deity of fertility, fertility for the fields and crops, and protector of farm animals and crops. (Note: I will use the Tagalog term “siya” to refer to he/she as Lakapati is transgender. In Tagalog we don’t have a term for “he/him and she/her” in our language like English does since “siya” is gender neutral, meaning it refers to both he/him and she/her. Because there is no English equivalent of siya for someone who is gender neutral I will being using the Tagalog term siya here for this purpose.) Siya was the deity who gave the gift of agriculture to mankind and Lakapati literally means, “giver of food”.
            <br>
            In some myths Lakapati is married to Mapulon, the God of the Seasons, and gave birth to Anagolay, the Goddess of Lost Things. In another myth Lakapati was the consort of Bathala who was also transgender, and siya was the one that began the creation of the world while Bathala finished it.
            <br>
            The most common offerings to siya was to put a plate of rice when there was a full moon around seven in the evening. Or if people needed Lakapati’s help with any trouble, they would offer plants and herbs of any kind. During planting time, Lakapati was worshiped in the fields by carrying around carved figures and statues of siya, same way we carry the Sta. Nino figures for worship and blessings today. During rituals and offerings in the fields, farmers would hold up a child up in the air while invoking the deity directly, saying “Lakapati, pakanin mo yaring alipin mo, huwag mo gutumin.” (Translation: Lakapati, feed this servant who is yours, let him/her not be hungry) Note: alipin does mean slave, however it also means servant and in this translation of alipin it is stating how the people are the servants of Lakapati asking for Lakapati’s blessings for the fertility and protection of crops.</p>
