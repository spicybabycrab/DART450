            <h1>The Fragrant Companion</h1>
            <h2>(Chinese: 憐香伴)</h2>
        </hgroup>

        <p class="fragrant rev" id="p1">The Fragrant Companion is a Chinese play by Li Yu, written in 1651. The story is about two girls, Cui Jianyun (崔笺云) and Cao Yuhua (曹语花), who adored each other after their intercourse by writing poems and wanted to be together all the time. This story is about female homosexuality in a patrilineal society.</p>
       
       
        <p class="fragrant rev" id="p2">Cui Jianyun, the scholar Fan Jiefu (范介夫)'s wife, went to a temple to burn joss to the gods after her honeymoon. At the temple she meets Cao Yuhua, the daughter of Lord Cao and 2 years her junior. Madame Cui is attracted to Cao's extraordinary fragrance, and Miss Cao is attracted to Madame Cai's poetic talent. They fall in love and vow to be husband and wife in the next life. In order to live together, Madame Cui persuades her husband to send a matchmaker to Lord Cao's house, asking him to grant her daughter to him as a second wife.</p>
        
        <p class="fragrant rev" id="p3">Lord Cao flies into a rage at the thought of his daughter becoming a mere concubine. He throws out the matchmaker, and leaves at once for the capital with Miss Cao, ordering Fan stripped of his title. </p>
        
        <p class="fragrant rev" id="p4">After numerous twists and turns, Cui Jianyun and Cao Yuhua manage to reunite at the expense of both being the wives of Fan Jiefu.</p>
