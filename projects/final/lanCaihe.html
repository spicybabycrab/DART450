            <h1>Lan Caihe</h1>
            <h2>(Chinese: 摩梭)</h2>
        </hgroup>

        <p class="lan rev" id="p1">Lan Caihe (藍采和) is the patron saint of florists and minstrels (or “singing courtesans” since the musical lifestyle in classical China often bore some relation to the pleasure trade). </p>
       
        <p class="lan rev" id="p2">Their name means ‘red-footed genius’, alluding to a strong connection with the earth and rich soil. Their sacred emblem is the flower basket, a bamboo or wicker container born on a hoe-like handle filled up with sacred flowers, herbs, and plants. Lan Caihe is also sometimes shown holding castanets, playing a flute, or riding a crane.</p>
        
        <p class="lan rev" id="p3">Ambiguity and the reversal of expectations are trademarks of this immortal as is the power of unheeded prophecy. In addition to not having a fixed gender, Lan Caihe dons heavy winter clothes in summer but strips down to a flimsy barely-there shift to sleep in snowbanks in the winter. Sometimes they are portrayed within a melting snowbank transforming into steam from quasi-divine magic.</p>
        
        <p class="lan rev" id="p4">While some of the eight immortals have lengthy or complicated creation stories (involving magic items or a lifetime of study) Lan Caihe’s apotheosis to immortality was quick and random. </p>
        
        <p class="lan rev" id="p5">While playing music, drinking heavily, and otherwise entertaining at a bar, Lan Caihe got up to go to the bathroom. Suddenly, unexpectedly, they flew up to heaven on a crane letting a single shoe fall down. Despite having immense power and magic (and immortality), Lan Caihe is frequently portrayed dressed in a frayed blue dress and only one shoe, consorting with the lowest classes of society. There are few figures from any mythology more evocative of than socially constructed nature of identity than this gender-ambiguous immortal.</p>
