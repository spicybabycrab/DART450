            <h1>The Story of Two Star-crossed Lovers, Orihime and Hikoboshi / Tanabata </h1>
            <h2>(Japanese: 七夕)</h2>
        </hgroup>

        <p class="star rev" id="p1">Tanabata, or the Star Festival takes place on the seventh day of the seventh month to commemorate the love story of the two stars, Vega and Altair.
            Princess Orihime, daughter of the god of heavens, was a seamstress who spent her days weaving beautiful silk clothes by the starry river, the Milky Way. </p>

        <p class="star rev" id="p2">Being so preoccupied with her weaving, Orihime became lonely, wishing for companionship. One day, from across the river, she saw a figure leading a herd of cows across the night sky. Intrigued, she left her weaving behind, crossing the river to meet them. </p>

        <p class="star rev" id="p3">She learned that the cow herder’s name was Hikoboshi, and the two fell in love instantly.</p>

        <p class="star rev" id="p4">In their devotion, the two began to neglect their respective duties—cows wandered across the heavens freely, and the silk weavings were left forgotten. Orihime’s father then forbade the lovers to be together, permanently separating them on opposite sides of the Milky Way. However, Orihime pleaded with him, he decreed that his daughter could cross the river once a year—on the 7th day of the 7th month—to be reunited with her star-crossed lover.</p>
