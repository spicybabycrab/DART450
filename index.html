      <h2>How Facebook Changed the World: The Arab Spring</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>"How Facebook Changed the World: The Arab Spring" is a BBC documentary film of how the Arab world erupted in revolution in the early 2010s, which began as a response to oppressive regimes and low standards of living in Tunisia. The catalyst which sparked the movement was when Tunisian street vendor Mohammed Bouazizi set himself on fire to protest the arbitrary seizing of his vegetable stand by police over failure to obtain a permit. His friends responded by spreading the call to protest against their oppressors by using social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube in order to organize themselves so that everyone was on the same page, working together towards a common goal. They were able to spread their message not only amongst themselves, but to people all over the world which helped them gain support for their mission. The street protests that ensued in Tunis, the country’s capital, eventually prompted authoritarian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to abdicate his position and flee to Saudi Arabia. Activists in other countries in the region were inspired by the regime change in Tunisia, and began to protest similar authoritarian governments in their own nations. The participants in these grassroots movements sought increased social freedoms and greater participation in the political process and the political and social impact of these popular uprisings remains significant today, years after many of them ended. 
      </p><br>
      <p>The Arab Spring instigated a change in the use of social media as instruments to promote a collective identity and mobilize people online and offline. Recent movements like #MeToo, #BlackLivesMatter, #NoBanNoWall, and #UmbrellaRevolution have played significant roles facilitating and disseminating our daily engagement with politics. It’s interesting to see how access to basic technology can address big challenges across cultures and across time zones. </p>

      <h2>Social Media and the Activist Toolkit: User Agreements, Corporate Interests, and the Information Infrastructure of Modern Social Movements</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Last week, we watched the documentary “How Facebook Changed the World: The Arab Spring”, which demonstrated how empowering social media can be for activists to gather and gain support from masses. The article this week “Social Media and the Activist Toolkit”, written by William Lafi Youmans and Jillian C. York for the Journal of Communication, looks on the other side on activism and speaks about how social media can be used by authoritarian regimes to prohibit anonymity, practice community policing, perpetuate campaigns from regime loyalists, and use counterinsurgency tactics against democracy advocates. Four cases are examined in which social media design and policies created tension between the sociopolitical uses by activists and the commercial interests of the platform owners: “We Are All Khaled Said”: Banning anonymous users, Youtube videos from Syria: Banning offensive content, The anti-atheist Facebook campaign: Community policing abuse, and The Syrian Electronic Army: Authoritarian social media use. These cases all involved one primary social media platform (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo), and as profit-seeking entities, they fall under capitalist gain. When state power comes to bear on them, they comply as long as it retains and gains users, develops new revenue streams, and avoids liability and bad publicity, thus lessening social media’s utility. 
      </p><br>
      <p>There are strategies to get around this: activists can jump to new social media platforms en masse, apply extant legal doctrines against social media companies, appeal directly to governments that are committed to an open Internet and democratization, work to advance industry self-regulation, pressure social media companies via incremental advocacy, or embrace civic technologies.

      <h2>Culture Jamming and Brandalism for the Environment </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>This week’s reading “Culture jamming and Brandalism for the environment: The logic of appropriation” by Eleftheria J. Lekakis explores creative activism for environmentalism through an examination of culture jamming. Specifically it looks to the action of the Brandalism project during the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21). Brandalism in this case is the encroachment of ads, logos, and other types of corporate branding into public and traditionally non-commercial spaces, or the dissemination of corporate messages through methods or mediums not typically used for marketing purposes. This form of creative activism presents new possibilities for a progressive politics and mobilize artists, activists, and volunteers for causes such as environmentalism.  
      </p><br>
      <p>During the COP21, under the state-of-emergency ban on protests, artists and activists replaced the advertising panels of 600 bus stops in Paris with their own messages. The Brandalism project draws a strong link between the advertising industry as an industry of perpetuating rampant consumerism and its environmental consequences. The cultural and environmental aspects of this type of creative activism productively intersect (corporate greed, inadequate politicians, consumer saturation , the earth in mourning). It demonstrates how a spectacle can be ethical, how the politics of environmentalism can benefit from creative tactics, and how activists and artists are increasingly implicated in contemporary social change.

      <h2>The Yes Men Are Revolting</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>“The Yes Men Are Revolting” is a 2014 documentary film directed by Laura Nix and The Yes Men, a culture jamming duo who use the aliases Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno. The Yes Men are a culture jamming group that use satirical performance art to make political points. While impersonating public relations personnel, they hold fake press conferences where they announce corporations, governments, and other organizations have taken a new, leftist stance. The film follows their exploits as they prank various organizations and corporations who engage in climate change denial. After a nonetheless successful stunt later at the COP15 Climate Change Summit in Copenhagen, Bichlbaum and Bonanno are defeated by the lack of change from the conference, the ominous corporations winning again in the struggle within world government for proper resources. They separate, which inadvertently provides the Yes Men saga needed personal reflection time about where they've come from. During these segments, Bonanno focuses on his expanding family, while sharing with us the activism planted in him from his parents. Meanwhile, Bichlbaum breaks up with his boyfriend, reflects upon his own childhood, and begins to work with other members of the Yes Men brigade for a stunt against the Shell company.
      </p><br>
      <p>The film raises questions about the lives of activists and how sometimes no matter how much one dedicates their lives to push and protest, there comes a point where it feels like nothing is changing. But change happens incrementally and Bichlbaum and Bonanno are hopeful and derive fresh meaning from the process of rediscovery. Their ongoing commitment has a triumphant quality not because the world takes notice — it has done that before — but because they finally appreciate their place in it.

      <h2>Tweeting Ferguson</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>In this week’s article “Thank you, Black Twitter: State Violence, Digital Counter-publics, and Pedagogies of Resistance”, Marc Lamont Hill talks about ways that Black people in the US have used Back Twitter and other digital counterpublics to engage in forms of pedagogy that reorganize relations of surveillance, reject rigid respectability politics, and contest the erasure of marginalized groups within the Black community. He specifically focuses on the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. On August 9, 2014, Michael Brown Jr., an 18-year old African American man, was fatally shot by 28-year-old white police officer Darren Wilson despite having placed his hands in the air in an act of surrender. Moments after his death, people used cell phones to capture photo and video footage of his dead body, which circulated on social media (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter). The outrage that his corpse wasn’t attended for in 4.5 hours was expressed on Black Twitter, a virtual community that engaged in real-time discourses related to Black American culture and politics. The hashtags #MichaelBrown #Ferguson and #HandsUpDontShoot, transformed Brown’s death from a local event to an international cause. Black Twitter became a “digital counterpublic”: a digital community in which members actively resist hegemonic power, contest majoritarian narratives, engage in critical dialogues, or negotiate oppositional identities. 
      </p><br>
      <p>Smartphone technologies has enabled Black youth to digitally capture (through photography, video, and live-streaming) everyday interactions with law enforcement without the support of mainstream corporate media outlets or State-owned surveillance technologies. Smartphone technologies enable Black citizens to surveil State agents and institutions, thereby holding the State and its apparatuses accountable for practices of anti-Black violence and other forms of social injustice.
